# Glat/Glong

Glat/Glong is a Chrome extension for finding the precise latitude and longitude of a point on Google Maps. 

The extension adds a red dot at the center of the map. Clicking the dot reveals the center's coordinates. Glat/Glong works on both the new ("preview") and old versions Google Maps.

__Mac/Linux users__: Coordinates will appear in an `alert` popup, as well as in the Chrome developer console.

__Windows users__: Coordinates will appear in the Chrome developer console.
